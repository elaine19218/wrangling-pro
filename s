It was thanks to Tami's idea that we managed to return back home without too much hassle and before the chaos in US airports.

I arrived at Melissa's adorable garden apartment just 7 days before NYC was declared a coronavirus hotspot.  I was scheduled to stay at her place for a month while working on a dream job... and then my job was cancelled.  Melissa was very cooperative in dealing with Airbnb and making sure that we could cancel the reservation and that I could see a refund for the unused time.  I am very grateful.  The apartment has everything you need for a longer stay and is situated in the fantastic neighborhood of Carroll Gardens.  I wished I could have stayed longer!!!!  Best wishes and a million thanks to Melissa and her family.",2020,"3",22,TRUE

Was cleaned a bit on the surface but everything else was full of dust, dirty tissues, ear plugs, feathers was extremely unhealthy. I ended up with breathing issues at night because of the amounts of dust. Fridge also not cleaned and full of perishable food, no exchange sheets for the bed ( I was supposed to stay one month). Host was giving no proper solutions, suggested I should buy swiffers when I asked for a vacuum cleaner. Or broom. That kind of dirt was requiring much more than a swiffer. Same for laundry, she promised a solution and never came back to me. The other guest that I was supposed to share with decided to stay with relatives because of the hygiene issues.
I tried to solve the issue on my own and not ruin all my time in my trip on trying to get something from the host that came across not really interested in the situation she created but the covid pandemic occurred and at this point the place became a threat to my health and my safety. Informed by airbnb on this specific reservation that I am entitled to a full refund due to the covid pandemic and lock down and because I could not risk to get quarantined or sick in a place with hygiene issues that already caused me health problems, I left the place two weeks earlier under 2 extenuating circumstances: covid pandemic, and big hygiene issues on a pandemic requiring extreme care on that matter. I wrote the host about the situation and my departure and she never replied. I wrote her again a few days after, still no reply.  In such a critical global situation and after literally jeopardising people health and stay with literally no care being taken on her duties as a host I would expect a reaction, an explanation and a solution.",2020,"3",16,TRUE

She goes out of her way to make you feel home. At the same time she has the ability to perfectly balance between being present and supportive and giving you all the room and privacy you need to feel as you were in your own apt. I immensely appreciated the time together and tours around the city. Regarding the room, I spent significant time there home working (due to COVID19) and I felt really comfortable. The room is very well furnished and decorated, and I didn't miss anything. You have your own bathroom and the weekly cleaning is also great. I was mostly cooking myself as the kitchen has all the appliances and utensils you would need. The apt. is located in a relative recent building facing a park and the neighbourhood felt secure (I was walking a lot). Also you will find supermarkets and all sort of shops and restaurants 2 steps away. There is also a very conveniently located subway station.

The host is very responsive which meant any questions we had during our stay were answered promptly. The check-in and check-out process using Key Cafe around the corner was also very easy. The location is also quite central to most places. We avoided subways because of COVID and took an Uber everywhere and it was fairly cheap to do so from this place.

First of all, Lynne's place is tidy, cozy and beautiful. Our private room and bathroom were perfect for privacy after a day walking the streets of NYC. The appartment is perfectly located in the awesome neighborhood of Williamsburg : you just have a 5 min walk to the L train which leads to midtown in 15 min. The neighborhood is safe with every facilities around, it's also very friendly and have some cool places to hang out.
But what we'll remember the most, in these troubled times, is probably Lynne's kindness. We were 2 French tourist stuck between covid19 outbreak in our country AND in the US. We had to reschedule our flight and get back home early. She was very understanding and tried to help us as she could. We very felt like we had at least one people from family in this foreign country. We will always remember that very bizarre but cool holidays with her and hope to get back there ASAP.

Thank you Lynne for everything, you made that strange vacation one of our kindest memory.",2020,"3",16,TRUE

You enter a building at street level with several apartments and it’s one flight up, with two bedrooms with windows off a central living and dining space that is open to a kitchen and has an adjacent bathroom.  The quiet apartment was clean and had all the amenities indicated in the listing.  Mr. W. does not appear to live there but was friendly and clear in communications and responded extremely fast when messaged via Airbnb or telephoned.  He met us at the apartment to provide building keys and a keypad code used to enter the apartment itself.

Unfortunately, the timing of our visit was not good, as we arrived the very day major activities in the city began closing because of COVID-19, so we decided to cut our visit short and stayed only three of the nine nights we had reserved.  But our time there was very pleasant.

The apartment is well located in Brooklyn, on Warren St. close to 4th Ave. and several short blocks from a number of subway lines and easy access to the rest of NYC.  You’ll find 5th Ave. a more useful neighborhood street to check out, with its excellent range of shops, restaurants, etc., and a Key Food Supermarket close by.",2020,"3",21,TRUE

It’s also very close to Times Square/theatre district, Chelsea, meatpacking,  30min from SOHO, and 40min from the East Village if you are a tourist. The space is nicely furnished and pretty spacious for a Manhattan 2BR. I know I carry a lot of stuff and it never felt crowded. It’s an old apt (like most of Manhattan), but Judson was very communicative and quick about any repairs or questions. This apt is about a 6-8min walk from the ACE (to east side, queens, and BK) trains and about it 10min from the 123 (uptown, downtown) so access is pretty good in general. It’s 30min from Trader Joe’s (70th(?) and broadway) and there are plenty of urgent cares and CVS within 20min. Some people may be deterred from a 5th floor walk up, but it is quietest and safest in my option/experience for a more congested area in NYC. We had an overall good experience for our stay. We left amid the COVID-19 outbreak and Judson was very flexible about changing our end date since our jobs were working from home at that point and we wanted to return home to our families. I really only have one caution is that the apartment does have an old radiator heating system so it does make some noise. However, the room with the radiator is the street side anyway, so it doesn’t really make a big difference. Lighter sleepers— take the smaller room. Normal to heavier sleepers— this makes no difference. Overall great experience, thanks Judson!",2020,"3",22,TRUE

Gregory brought us an extra chair, a new microwave and a toaster within hours of my request, and repaired the recliner as soon as the part arrived. We had to leave early due to the COVID 19 emergency and Lana put in for a refund for us.

If you read many of his other reviews (at least 8 of them) those who stay more then one day he always causes them problems. Rude, impolite, selfish are all very accurate ways to describe him as mentioned by other guests. NOT WORTH ANY SAVINGS TO STAY WITH HIM AS HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT OTHERS and is a LIAR! UNSAFE!!

He is DISHONEST. He mentions his mom is VISITING him. Yet, reviews over the past 4 years tell otherwise. His MOM actually LIVES with him secretly in the LIVING room, and she doesn’t speak English. Imagine the confusion when she stays home all day and tries to talk with you every time you go to the kitchen or leave the house. She will use the bathroom and kitchen all day and you will
NOT have access to the amenities that you paid for.

He ALSO rents out his room WITHOUT his landlords permission, hence he tries to have you go to the side of the apartment, late at night which is very unsafe.  He will also LAUGH at you if you struggle finding his hidden secret entrance for Airbnb guests late at night! HORRIBLE RUDE PERSON! DISHONEST.

2. I had a friend come over to grab something and said she would be gone within a few minutes. We were SUPER quiet and the only way he would have known is if he stayed in his room, watching his crazy security cameras. Without seconds, HE FREAKED out and THREATENED to call the POLICE saying I “broke his rules”! . After checking his “RULES” again he has more rules than most FATHERS do for their 8 year old DAUGHTER. HE THREATENED TO ALSO PUSH ME OUT OF THE HOUSE if I did NOT leave!! AGGRESSIVE AND HOSTILE!! He stood in my room for nearly 2 HOURS after she left trying to reach Airbnb at 830pm. Eventually I felt uncomfortable and left around 10pm. I reported to Airbnb and he should be off this website due to multiple unnecessary threats.   Again, AVOID him, he is NOT a people person or good with people at all.

THANKFULLY, last minute alternative hotels were cheap due to COVID-19 and  I left that night. I was promised by Airbnb support already a refund of the last 2 nights + his strange cleaning fee thankfully. THIS GUY IS STRANGE AND ENJOYS TRYING TO MAKING OTHETS LIVES MISERABLE. He should NOT be allowed to host and 4.2 reviews for a host are VERY LOW compared to competitors. HE ENJOYS FEELING POWERFUL AND ABUSING HIS RIGHTS AS A HOST. VERY STRANGE GUY. Honestly believe he gets jealous of others easily and lacks confidence in himself. He clearly lives a very stressful NYC life trying to make ends meet.

3. OLD OLD HOUSE, cold shower,  HARD bed, SLOW wifi.

Aurelie is an amazing host. Very kind and responsive. The space was clean and comfortable with nice amenities. The bathroom looked freshly remodeled by someone with a good idea for design. Very well done.

If you stay, familiarize yourself with the pictures and (Hidden by Airbnb) Street view before you arrive to check in. We were a little confused as to which house it was at first die to lack of street numbers. Once we pulled up the photos to compare it was easily identifiable. Check in and out was a breeze.

Five minute walk from major bus stops and the train station. Short ride to the ferry.

The children’s toys and books kept my daughter entertained when we were in the apartment and the apartment itself kept myself and my husband entertained.

The layout was perfect in relation to having our wee girl nearby but also in her own room. Sam was a great host, loads of communication and the apartment manual was really helpful. Williamsburg area is really cool and we found lots of vegan places to eat. We even found an all vegan American style diner for breakfast called Champs.

Comfy beds in 2 double-sized bedrooms & storage space for clothes, a fab living space with a couch & tv & full kitchen.

Right by the subway and near great neighborhoods.  The place was a bit dirty overall- disappointing.  There was no overhead light in the bathroom- just a small desk lamp on a shelf.  only one lightbulb in each light so the entire apartment was dark.  No soap- really?  But there were 5 bottles of used shampoo...  None in the bathroom or kitchen.  Bed was just ok.   A good cleaning is necessary.
Unfortunately, this was at the height of the coronavirus situation when everything started closing.  I know this is his business, but he was very adamant that he would not even compromise on payment for 2 nights that we were going to leave early.

They stayed and visited local sights.) They said: Pros: If you are attending anything at the Barclay Center, the location can’t be beat.  They were able to find parking on the street, extensive breakfast was a plus, check-in was easy, great communication from the host. They also said it was nice and quiet. Cons: The only issue they experienced, was that the listing had said two beds, but they didn’t even see the second bed the first night (and ended up having to share the Queen), which turned out to only be a blowup mattress located in a common area. I don’t think I would’ve rented this for them if I had known that. They discovered the (not inflated) blow up mattress the second night. Despite the 2nd bed situation, they said they’d stay there again during an A10 conference due to the great location and tasty breakfast! (FYI, I did check the listing before writing this review to make sure I didn’t miss anything, and could not find any mention of the second bed being an uninflated air mattress in a common area.

Some of the things that stand out about William are strong communication (he is very responsive and actively checks in during the stay). Additionally William went above and beyond, as this stay was during COVID in NYC, to check if I needed anything towards the end of my stay, and gave mes some flexibility with the check-out time to help me move out. This is also a really fun neighborhood, and you are literally a 2 minute walk from the B, D trains (and Canal street is 2 min the other way).

The apartment is as described. There is a small common area with a kitchenette and kitchen table, and the entrance hall has a small seating bench with a good view over the window. One other room was a guest from AirBNB, and the third room was William's permanent apartment-mate.

I had a slight problem with the host because he was situated right next to the bathroom and we felt like we had no privacy. When my boyfriend and I walked in (bf had forgotten to book for two people instead of one) the host came out, alarmed, and asked us to immediately pay him extra for the guest. We paid him online right there and thought it would be a smooth ride, but then..
I was coughing in the bathroom the next morning (I come from a hot climate, have allergies, and smoke cigarettes. It was our last night in NY so we smoked and drank the night before). He heard me from his room and accused me of having the coronavirus. I was shocked because that’s an accusation not out of concern for my health but of my supposed irresponsibility. I told him no and left right after. The media and people like this have really made NYC hard place to visit if you have a slight cough.
The bathroom also has rules on it - no more than 15mins, and clean the shower after. Why would we do chores when we’re paying $95 for a tiny ass room for the night?
I did appreciate the host for letting us stay a couple hours past checkout. As soon as he heard me cough though, he said “please check out soon.”

The apartment felt like home almost immediately. It was clean, cozy, and had everything equipped for a long or short stay (including a washer and dryer!). The bed and couch were very comfortable. For anyone working or streaming, the internet was fast and reliable as well. The kitchen was clean, well stocked and had everything I needed to cook.
The apartment is located within walking distance to supermarkets, wine stores, coffee shops and two train limes that will take you anywhere you need to go. 

I arrived in this apartment right as NYC was told to work from home due to COVID-19. So I spent two weeks inside the apartment simply living and working. The place truly felt like home and kept me sane, and I could not recommend this place enough for anyone passing through NYC for any period of time.",2020,"3",28,TRUE

I was going to live in the apartment full-time while my partner travelled back and forth from Europe. Booking their place was the best decision ever. 

First of all, the apartment is fantastic: it is spacious and beautiful, and it has absolutely everything you need, including a smart TV, a washing machine and a dryer. It is very close to the Nostrand avenue subway station, but not close enough to hear any subway noises. It is extremely clean, quiet and calm. It has a beautiful back garden, and I really enjoyed sitting by the kitchen window and having a cup of coffee while I enjoyed the sunshine and the garden view. Our stay was already worthy of the five stars because of the apartment and the very warm welcome Lina & Steven gave us. They left a bottle of prosecco and some coffee in the fridge for us. They introduced us to their lovely dog Lawford and even had us over for wine one night. On my first week in New York, while my partner was away, Lina took me out for coffee and showed me around in the neighbourhood. They made us feel welcome, were quick to respond to any questions and were definitely the best AirBnb hosts we have ever stayed with. 

Then the COVID-19 crisis hit, and they did much more than being excellent hosts. I had to cancel the rest of our stay and quickly return home. Not only did they completely understand and made it easy for me to move out in a rush, but they also went out of their way to help me. They edited the booking so I wouldn’t have to pay for the remaining weeks, and on top of that they offered to pay for my taxi to the airport. Their hospitality and kindness was overwhelming.

The mattress was really comfortable. Place was clean and shower was hot. We were very satisfied with the value we got for the money. Just one thing, the comforter is usually difficult to wash and we were a bit taken back because there was no sheet under the comforter and it didn’t have a removable outer envelope sheet that could be easily washed.

When we arrived to the place, we took a look around and there was hair on the bathroom floor. One of the rules was that you cannot wear shoes inside, but it felt so dirty we had to wear our flip flops when using the bathroom. And there was no type of hand soap in the bathroom. Secondly, the kitchen table and counters were dirty and there was food in the sink (strawberries and noodles), so we changed our minds about using this area. The room was neat and comfy. However, sleeping here was not ideal. In the mornings, the host, Mariana and a male individual were loud in speaking, opening cabinets and other kitchen appliances. There was also very loud banging from above the ceiling, it was constant the whole morning. I did not receive the greatest communication from Daniel. I reached out to him regarding our flights arriving early and asked if we could check in early, he didn’t respond. A day later, I sent another message asking for a response asap and thankfully he did allow us to. Similar instance occurred when asking to obtain a refund due to covid19, his responses were slow. The patio did not match the photos in regards to the furniture that is displayed. It was also very uncomfortable for us for our host to ask to say that we are not Airbnb guests if anyone asked, but his friends or family, etc. This is not something you want to worry about when out in vacation!

They just make everything like check in much easier and guests dont have to worry about misplacing a key! I felt safe in the neighborhood,  even at night and there were many great restaurants around. The L train station is extremely close and we used that most of the time to get to Manhattan in 40-50minutes. Even though we ended up spending about half our time in the Airbnb because of COVID-19 things like Oscars gorgeous huge HD TV and close proximity to restaurants for ubereats and doordash kept us plenty entertained. Again, I really appreciated the cleanliness of this place, especially with COVID-19 rapidly spreading. The worst part, which personally I didnt mind, was that there seemed to be a basketball court or something right outside the window and the people playing could get a little loud, but i also understand that under normal, non virus related circumstances, we would have been out of the Airbnb a lot more and probably never would have experience that.",2020,"3",18,TRUE

* Fiona is very responsive, she gets back to you within seconds with anything you may need.

* Awesome location and safe. (You are close to the A,B,C,D lines and 2 train--It is a 5 minute walk to the station and I was able to get to downtown in 25 - 30 minutes) 

* The Room and bathroom are very spacious and look just like the pictures posted.

* I had originally booked the room for 2 weeks, as I was in NYC training for work. However, my training was cut short due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Fiona allowed me to cancel the remainder of my stay and graciously refunded me for the additional week I had booked.

* I was able to get a parking spot right in front of the house. I had no problems parking there for a week. You do have to watch your car and move it for street sweeping though.

Cons:
*If you are sensitive to noise, the walls are pretty thin so you can hear anytime a toilet is flushed from upstairs, conversations downstairs, etc. Nothing some headphones can't handle though  :)

* There is not a way to lock the main door to your room. You can lock the door leading into your closet and bathroom though. I didn't prefer this, because I didn't keep all of my stuff in the closet area. However, they have cameras (Website hidden by Airbnb) if you feel a little uneasy, Fiona will quickly look at camera footage and allow you to view it as well to ensure you that your stuff is safe.

* I had a few issues with smelling smoke given that the area where someone may smoke is outside, a floor down from your window ( I am an asthmatic, so Im very sensitive to this) . There is an AC unit in the window, so there is a bit of a crack left in the window. Sometimes, the smoke would waft inside of the room because of this. So, if you're sensitive to smoke just give Fiona the heads up so she can direct whoever is smoking elsewhere so it doesn't bother you.",2020,"3",14,TRUE

"9712",29365401,617070474,"2020-03-11",132983908,"Zoe","Overall David's place fit my needs well enough. The price is unbeatable and the neighborhood is great with plenty of lovely restaurants and bars. It is literally just a few minutes walk away from the subway that will take you right into Manhattan or anywhere else you want to go, so traveling around the city was easy. David was very diligent about cleaning around the house, which I appreciated especially with the COVID-19 outbreak going on.

However, the cheap price obviously comes with some downsides. There was very very little privacy in my room as it was only separated from the room next to it and the hallway/kitchen area by a screen door covered with a sheet. There were many people also staying in the Airbnb including David, so I could hear everything anyone said or did in the kitchen and I slept pretty poorly my entire trip as a result. I had no way to lock the screen door to my room, so didn't feel comfortable leaving my valuables in the room. Luckily I knew the people staying in the room next to mine, otherwise I probably would've felt very unsafe as a young woman traveling alone.

David was very nice to talk to and seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me, and offered me homemade dumplings! However, we did have some miscommunication issues. A few times he woke me up very early to offer me breakfast or coffee, and I was unable to fall back asleep. 

I don't know if I would stay again given this experience, but I would say that the price of the room was ideal for traveling on a budget and let me spend my money on doing fun things in the city instead.",2020,"3",11,TRUE

There was some misunderstanding about whether we would come since it was the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the cleaning lady cleaned the place, we went to nearby Italian restaurant Saraghina for pizza and drinks (tip: go between 4 and 6 pm for 1/2 price pizza and wine). The place is secure (3 locked doors!) and beautifully decorated. The beds are comfortable and each room is amply heated as needed. We didn't expect to self-isolate and didn't mind not having a TV, but with the restaurants and bars restricted to take-out/delivery, and museums, Broadway shows etc. all closing, we tried to make the best of it by exploring a nearly deserted Brooklyn. Vida was lovely and provided us with Lysol wipes, hand sanitizer and anything else we asked for. She provided us with lots of tips and great suggestions about places to visit, even in these strange times. It's too bad we had to leave earlier than expected. With the city shutting down, it was the right decision. We hope to come back another time soon, to healthy, thriving Brooklyn and stay at Vida's again.",2020,"3",19,TRUE

If you like to walk (as we do), taking 30 minutes to walk over Williamsburg bridge to Manhattan is wonderful. 

The apartment itself is perfect. Very spacious for four travellers, great amenities and homey decor. High ceilings and room to kick back and relax. It's an AirBnb that you're simply relieved to arrive at after long travels - I think that's the best way to describe it.

Check-in was very smooth and it introduces you to the great deli on the corner, which has everything you need for a pre-dinner-snack or your morning coffee. Try their everything bagels, they are great.

Tip: If you're tired on your first night and still feel like going for a good meal and drinks, book a table at Maison Premiere which is more or less across the street. They have great service, great food and provide a gorgeous space for first night out.

Thanks to Diego for being a wonderful host, quick to reply and very kind when we had to leave quickly and prematurely (We were called home because of COVID-19 - all Danes abroad were called home March 2020).

I always choose a super host when booking as I have don’t want to worry about anything when I book the place. This time I made the biggest mistake choosing this super host. Their listing is misleading and false...beware, they claim they have a newly renovated luxury place with new appliances. This is a blatant lie. As soon as you walk in there’s a horrible smell no idea where it came from, the TV was as huge as a dresser but what’s the point it must be from sometime in the 90s and worse part it does not work. Next thing someone removed the knob from the stove. Fridge was a disgrace so old and dirty, they had placed a vase inside fridge to catch dripping water from freezer I guess, there was black stuff who knows what it was on the fridge door and the freezer was so old and dirty I didn’t put any food there. Besides that there’s a microwave only which was ok. I immediately reached out to the host and said I didn’t think it was going to work as I had a 4 year old child with me who needs tv and I explained the oven part as I was looking forward to using it to cook for my family, host said that the other person name Lucas was somewhere in France and would tell me how the tv worked the next day. Needless to say that next day came and went and nothing. Then the next day I received a message from Lucas asking if everything was ok, again I asked about the (Website hidden by Airbnb) answer ever was received. At the end with the whole coronavirus going stronger I asked for a refund for the nights I wasn’t going to stay, I booked for 14 nights we stayed 3 and dreaded everyone of them. This super host even though Airbnb reached out on my behalf has still to this point not refund me anything. When I keep asking I receive a two word answer just saying let me see and still nothing. I submitted a resolution report and they still have not answered to this point. Hugely disappointed and I keep asking how is this person a super host. I travel to Europe booked different places all over italy and Spain and here in the US I have never had an issue. As I review this persons reviews I noticed someone else reported the tv not working and they still listed it as nothing was wrong without even fixing it. This person has not shown good faith and to be honest I should receive a refund for all my booking due to their lie when listing and I am only asking for the nights I did not stay that for all I know he could have booked for someone else as I was clear I wasn’t there. Huge disappointment. Beware and don’t expect a “luxury” from this place because nothing in it has anything that comes close to that word.",2020,"3",20,TRUE

We had MORE than enough room for everyone and could’ve easily hosted more. This apartment is exactly as it appears in the pictures. The unit was sparkling clean! Very bright space with minimal, simplistic (but comfortable) furniture. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics as far as plates, cups, cooking utensils, etc. and the Keurig was a godsend (we brought a reusable K-cup and our own coffee grounds, but there were k-cups provided)! 

Overall, very nicely sized space, especially for an apartment in Brooklyn, and it’s in a safe area. We had no concern regarding our safety walking around the area to the parks (Lincoln Terrace Park), subway and grocery stores, and everything is easily within walking distance. There is no designated parking, so that’s important to note, but we didn’t have any trouble finding street parking! The commute to the city vía subway was about 40 minutes to Lower Manhattan and about 55 to Midtown/Central Park area. When you’re tired after a long day, that seems like quite the trip, but overall it wasn’t excessively long of a ride and it was nice to walk around on Eastern Pkwy with all the little shops and restaurants to get to the Utica station. 

Eli and Chani were super sweet! Unfortunately, our trip was scheduled just as this craziness with the COVID-19 has blown up, so we ended up having to cut the trip short and leave abruptly, but they were still so accommodating (even bringing us some toilet paper within a couple hours of requesting it! ).

I was told by the co-host Victoria that Shay just had a new child and has been busy lately, which I understand, but some of the issues I had were unacceptable. 

1. You should note that most, if not all, of Victoria and Shay's listings are from the same home. This means you would share the home with many other tenants/guests. This is something you should really keep in mind if you are looking to book a place during this covid-19 outbreak. I needed an affordable place that is close to work and I would've been ok with sharing space with a few people. Not 5+ people. 
2. The cleanliness of the place was not acceptable, even though they say they clean regularly. They definitely do not clean the communal refrigerators. You should bring your own house slippers or you'll have to wear socks throughout the whole house. That's all I'll say about that. 
3. Kitchen downstairs is in need of an upgrade or repair. There's only 1 working stove-top, the kitchen faucet is broken, and there is no microwave. You can use the kitchen upstairs which is fully built out, but that means you could come into contact with many more people which is something to think about if you're staying during covid-19.

But I have three complaints.

First, she has repeatedly told me that your flight was canceled by the new coronavirus and the airport is very busy, so it would be better to go to the stopover(Detroit) by bus on Friday evening, but my flights on Saturday morning were not canceled and the airport was not crowded at all. She also said she was planning to return to the southern area on Friday. So I felt that she wanted me to leave Airbnb on Friday to go back home as planned. It was very disappointing. 

Second, I'm not sure what she was doing, but the living room was full of paper waste. There were plenty of things on the table, and there was even no space to eat in living room. I thought she does not care much about her customers.

Third, I have now charged $ 67 for repairs of the bed. She claims that the wheels and frame have been broken. However, when I checked the photos, the wheels do not come off and the frame was not cracked up. The wheels have already moved poorly since we checked in, and the only one part of fraim is off, which you can fix easily with a screwdriver. 

The location is very good and the host is basically a good person, but I felt she is self-centered and does not care about her guests so much.

Thanks, but the reason I booked an Airbnb was NOT to stay in a hotel. Plus, that excuse makes zero sense. I ended up calling Airbnb the day of check in, explained the situation and was able to get a refund.

Generally I know airbnb does not offer refunds for this sort of thing, and I've never asked for one before in all my years of staying in airbnbs, but I figured Dawn and David would have been a little more understanding since theoretically I could have cancelled the entire booking last minute due to the virus and they would have lost the entire booking.

There is a big outside space with a trampoline which was great for our kid (although it was still winter weather). The flat is well equipped with everything you need and Mae allowed us to use the scooter and pushchair for our son. 

The checkin is easy with a lockbox outside the flat. The area (Greenpoint) is very nice, very diverse, with lots of little shops and cafes around - there is a large supermarket with lots of organic food around the corner (not cheap though...) and the ferry to Manhattan is about 7-9 min away, as are the two subway stations.

Airbnb should let them be free of charge since they truly embody the native spirit of this platform. 

A couple of tips:
- Be sure to ask Ian and Will about a chair in the living room. Seat down and relax.
- (this is mandatory) ask Ian about Mad. No joking, ASK him about this or take a look at some of the posters in the house.

Jonathan and Yvette were always there to help us and always offered us help and extra time to stay if we needed to. This was just one of many examples of the great hospitality they gave us. Probably the best hosts I've found in Airbnb in many years.",2020,"3",15,TRUE

The Check-in co-host was curtious and helpful. Listing clearly mentioned air mattress, which was not there and the cohost graciously brought one however it did not have the air pump and hence useless. Apartment was quite unclean with a dinky vacuum. 
We had reserved the apartment from Mar. 13-20, and due to force majeur COVID19 situation left NY on 16th. Air bnb were offering no cancelation etc., however in this special situation it would have been good if they helped the customers better.",2020,"3",20,TRUE

Second, the room (and the whole house) was richly decorated and many useful items were there to us to use, all super clean and tidy. Everything had a super cool and homy vibe and we did enjoy it so much, specially the cat that is such a sweetie. The COVID-19 stroke while we were there and I can assure you there won't be a better host, event in this difficult times. We were sad we had to leave earlier than planned but because of inestability of the airlines we had to leave a bit before. Lee was super understanding and helped a lot with everything. Plus! the house is located in Bushwick, not too close to be stressed but not to far to be lazy, you can walk easily to places from there and I must say that's pretty difficult to find in NYC. Summarizing, our stay in Lee's place was the best airbnb experience we ever had! Thanks so much!",2020,"3",24,TRUE

With the COVID-19 pandemic, Tasny checked up on us and made sure we were okay and equipped. A lot of the local tourist spots were closed because of the virus and luckily, we left New York just as all the restaurants were closing so our trip wasn’t interrupted too much. 
This apartment is just what you would expect in New York City! It’s in a PRIME location. 2 blocks from time square and on a quiet residential street. It is across from the subway going downtown and one block going uptown. There was a bus stop across the street too!The apartment was the perfect size and made us feel safe. There is a 24/7 doorman who monitors guests and they were super friendly! The apartment is simple and had all the necessities. There was a coffee pot available, Brita, microwave and soap/dishes. We didn’t have a chance to really utilize the stove and cook, but it is a great addition for those who have the time. The beds were perfect for us also. Two twin sized beds in the living room with a tv and a queen in the bedroom. I can’t express how great Apple and Tasny were and how they made the trip great even with everything going on in the world! This cute little apartment just further confirmed this is where I’m meant to live one day! Can’t wait to be back. Thank you again!",2020,"3",17,TRUE

We stayed in his place for a month and always felt welcomed thanks to his hospitality. It seems to me that his place is as same as(or better than) pictures and descriptions in Airbnb. I highly recommend his place for a couple or a small size family for the following reasons. 

First of all, his place is a very clean and spacious studio which is fully equipped (even with free Netflix&Disney&Hulu) with an affordable price. We couldn’t have lots of fun in New York city due to COVID-19 but we really enjoyed staying in his place thanks to Netflix and Disney with a huge and cozy sofa :-)

Secondly, it’s located near a subway (3-5 mins to F&G train by walk) which takes 15 mins to Soho, and bus (2 mins by walk) which take 10 mins to IKEA. 

Third, the neighborhood is so peaceful and surrounded with beautiful brownstones and there are lots of trendy boutique shops and restaurants nearby. Also, there is even a Trader Joe’s which is my favorite grocery store in NYC 15 mins by walk. 

Lastly, Mathieu is the best host I’ve ever met!!! We were looking for a place which we could check in with a day notice. Luckily, he made us feel welcomed even at the late hour. He gave us lots of useful information around the neighborhood and also a first aid kit just in case. Also, he provided us with toilet papers while NYC was having a toilet papers crisis due to COVID-19. He even gave us clean sheets and towels every week so we didn’t need to wash the sheets and towels by ourselves for a month. And he always responded to our messages and requests like changing light bulbs promptly. So we felt very comfortable in his place. 

When I visit NYC in the future, I will definitely stay in his place again!!!",2020,"3",31,TRUE

Long story short, my sister was unable to travel due to the travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus. I reached out to Daniela  and explained the situation, so I can at least get my money back. She didn’t answer my email, more did she answer the attempt made by Airbnb to her a full refund . It was totally out of my control, the least she could have done was have a heart and gave me back half my money. These are times where you see how evil people really are.

They went the extra mile to make sure I had information about the outbreak, as well as giving me advice on how to stay healthy and clean. The place was very neat, and as long as you’re okay sharing a space, it’s perfect. I appreciated the curtains for extra privacy. I was worried that the curtains separating the rooms would mean it would be noisy, but it was actually quiet! The hosts were also very reachable. The only small critique I have is the beds could be a tad softer, but for such a great price and location, I didn’t mind.",2020,"3",13,TRUE

The apartment was newly renovated, spacious and really clean. My trip was during the COVID-19 scare and Kat took extra measures to ensure everything was properly sanitized.

Andrew and Adrienne were so accommodating- everything from extreme early check-in to asking if I needed groceries. I live nearby, but I was locked out of my house during COVID19 until my landlord returned from upstate to let me in. Andrew’s apartment was extremely clean, and I felt safe. They even checked to see if I got back home safely. The bed is very comfortable, and the apartment is chic, and the layout makes it easy to get dressed and ready in the morning.",2020,"3",25,TRUE
